# Gemini Agent Plan: Comprehensive Reporting

**Goal:** Implement a comprehensive reporting system to analyze and display bot performance, decision patterns, and model comparisons. This will complete the final phase of the project roadmap.

---

### Phase 1: Backend Report Generation

The first step is to create a Python script that can generate the reports from the data stored in the database.

1.  **Analyze Existing Scripts:**
    *   Read `explanation_engine.py` and `model_evaluation.py` to understand their current capabilities for analyzing performance data.

2.  **Create a Central Report Generation Script:**
    *   Create a new Python script: `generate_reports.py`.
    *   This script will be the main entry point for generating all reports.

3.  **Implement Report Logic in `generate_reports.py`:**
    *   Connect to the unified `NS` MySQL database.
    *   Fetch data from the `LearningMetric` and `TradingPerformance` tables.
    *   Utilize the logic from `explanation_engine.py` and `model_evaluation.py` to process this data.
    *   Generate a detailed report in HTML format.
    *   Save the generated report to a new `reports/` directory (which I will create).

---

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration

Once reports can be generated, we need to make them accessible through the web interface.

1.  **Create a Reports Dashboard Page:**
    *   Create a new PHP file: `reports.php`.
    *   This page will serve as the main dashboard for viewing all generated reports.

2.  **Create an API to List Reports:**
    *   Create a new PHP API endpoint: `api/get-reports.php`.
    *   This endpoint will scan the `reports/` directory and return a JSON list of available report files.

3.  **Display the List of Reports:**
    *   On the `reports.php` page, use JavaScript to fetch the list of reports from the `api/get-reports.php` endpoint.
    *   Dynamically create a list of links that open each HTML report in a new tab.

4.  **Add Navigation Link:**
    *   Modify the main navigation menu (likely in a file like `includes/header.php` or `coins.php`) to add a link to the new "Reports" page.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Crypto Selection System (NEW)

**Goal:** Implement an intelligent ML/DL system to predict which crypto coins to buy based on age, marketcap, and volume per day.

#### **3.1 Feature Engineering Architecture (Implemented in `feature_engine.py`)**
- **Age-based Features**: Coin age momentum, age-adjusted volatility, lifecycle stage indicators
- **MarketCap Features**: MarketCap velocity, acceleration patterns, relative market position
- **Volume Features**: Volume discovery patterns, accumulation/distribution phases, volume-weighted price action

#### **3.2 Multi-Model Ensemble System (Initial Implementation in `crypto_selector.py` and `model_trainer.py`)**
- **Transformer Model**: For temporal pattern recognition in age/marketcap sequences
- **LSTM with Attention**: For long-term dependencies in volume/marketcap relationships
- **InceptionTime Model**: For multi-scale feature extraction from 3-input time series
- **Gradient Boosting**: For non-linear relationships between age/marketcap/volume
- **Ensemble Meta-Learner**: Combines all model predictions with confidence weighting

#### **3.3 Intelligent Scoring Algorithm (Implemented in `crypto_selector.py`)**
```python
Composite Score = (
    Technical_Momentum * 0.25 +
    Volume_Confirmation * 0.20 +
    Risk_Adjusted_Return * 0.20 +
    Market_Regime_Score * 0.15 +
    Correlation_Adjusted_Score * 0.20
)
```

#### **3.4 Risk Management Integration (Initial Implementation in `crypto_selector.py`)**
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Based on model confidence and market volatility
- **Maximum Drawdown Control**: Limit to <15% with automatic position reduction
- **Correlation Matrix**: Adjust portfolio weights based on coin correlations
- **Regime-Adaptive Scoring**: Adjust selection criteria based on bull/bear/sideways markets

#### **3.5 Real-Time Monitoring (Initial Implementation in `crypto_selector.py`)**
